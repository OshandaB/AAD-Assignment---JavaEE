# Point of Sale System - JavaEE Backend

This Java EE project is designed to provide a example of a fully functional application with a clear separation between the front-end and back-end components. This project serves as an educational resource to enhance understanding of Java EE development.

## Project Components

### Front-end

The front-end of the POS system is responsible for delivering a user-friendly interface, facilitating seamless interaction with the underlying functionalities. The front-end leverages HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX to create a dynamic and responsive web application.

### Back-end

The back-end of the POS system is implemented using JavaEE and is configured to run on the Apache Tomcat server. It provides the server-side logic for handling data processing, business rules, and database interactions.


### Features

JavaEE Architecture: Built using the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, providing a robust and scalable architecture for enterprise-level applications.

Apache Tomcat Server: Configured to run on the Apache Tomcat server, ensuring reliable and efficient web application hosting.

Data Processing: Implements server-side logic for handling data processing, facilitating seamless communication between the front-end and database.

Business Rules: Incorporates business rules to enforce logic and regulations specific to the Point of Sale domain.

Database Interactions: Manages interactions with the database, ensuring data integrity and security.
